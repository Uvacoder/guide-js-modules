# **Welcome to the Workshop! 🤗**

> In this workshop, I will try to teach everything I know about javascript module systems.

#### Here's what we will cover:

1. We'll start off by understanding what problems modules solve for us.

2. How did developers manage huge code bases even before modules were introduced to the JS
   ecosystem.

3. `IIFE`, `CJS` and `ESM` we'll have a look and try out all these formats and compare
   them.

(I've purposely left `AMD` and `UMD` formats for now.)

And at the end for bonus, we'll play around a little bit with `Deno` and it's
`URL imports` format.

##### if there is any remaining time, it can be used for asking questions if you have any.

  **Please note:** I believe in order to make most out of this workshop, basic JavaScript
  understanding is required. I won't be going through fundamental concepts like `Objects`,
  `Variables` or `Functions` etc.
