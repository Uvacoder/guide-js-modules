# **A Real Module format üßê**

Common JS or CJS for short, was the first real module format which got adopted by the JS
community.

Alot of people think [**Ryan Dahl**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Dahl) was the
creator of Common JS as it was widely used inside Node JS apps, But that's not true.

Common JS was started by A Mozilla engineer
[**Kevin Dangoor**](https://twitter.com/dangoor) in January 2009.

Node just adopted that module format. It didn't create it.

  **Please note:** To run the code examples on your own, you will need Node JS on your
  machine. If you don't have it installed, you can get it from here, [Download Node
  JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Syntax

This is how you share code in CJS:

**Script 1** (Creator)

```js
function sayHello(firstname) {
  console.log('Hey there ', firstname);
}

module.exports = sayHello;
```

**Script 2** (Consumer)

```js
const sayhello = require('./script-1');

sayHello();
```

In the above code, `Script 1` creates and exposes `sayHello` function, which is later
required by `Script 2` and then executed.

### üîç Few important points

> We will deep dive into these points with real code examples, in the workshop.

- Any file by the name `index` is treated as the root (top level file).
- It's loaded and parsed synchronously.
- Optionally you can omit the file extension like `.js`, the `require` function will
  automatically try to find the file.
- Files are required once and cached.
- `CJS` will not work in the browser. It will have to be transpiled and bundled.
