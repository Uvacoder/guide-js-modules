# **A hacky solution (IIFE) ðŸ«£**

Out of all the problems I talked about, the most non-trivial one is the `Scope collisions`

Developers introduced one hacky trick to provide script encapsulation, using **IIFEs** or
**Immediately invoked function expressions**

## But WTF is an IIFE? ðŸ™„

It's basically this thing,

```js
(function () {
  console.log("I'm a IIFE");
})();
```

**A function which is executed as soon as it's created**. That's what an IIFE is.

### But how does this solve our problem?

If you know anything about variable scoping in Javascript, you might recall this.

**Anything that's created inside a function, is LIMITED to that function only**

It's variable scope can't be accessed by anything outside that function.

### Applying this fix to our previous code.

```html
<body>
  <!-- Script 1 -->
  <script>
    (function () {
      let name = 'Sidharth';
      let details = { name };

      console.log('In Script 1', name, details);
    })();
  </script>

  <!-- Script 2 -->
  <script>
    (function () {
      console.log('In Script 2', name, details);
    })();
  </script>
</body>
```

### Conclusion

Even though this solves one main problem, and this is how many tools tried to tackle this
for a long time. It's not an ideal solution.

And we still got **2 problems left**.
