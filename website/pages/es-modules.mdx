# **ES Modules 🥹**

Ecmascript Modules or ESM for short, this format changed the JS ecosystem.

It's an offical Javascript proposal to implement a standard module system in the language.
It came out in 2015 with ES6 javascript. Most people are familiar with it these days.

## Syntax

This is how you share code in ESM:

**Script 1** (Creator)

```js
function sayHello(firstname) {
  console.log('Hey there ', firstname);
}

export default sayHello;
```

**Script 2** (Consumer)

```js
import sayHello from './script-1.js';

sayHello();
```

In the above code, `Script 1` creates and exposes `sayHello` function, which is later
imported by `Script 2` and then executed.

### Usage in the Browser

ESM is supported by most of the [modern browsers](https://caniuse.com/es6-module) these
days.

To enable ESM for a script you need to pass `type="module"` attribute to the script tag.

```html
<script src="script.js" type="module"> <script/>
```

### Usage in Node

All Node versions after v14, have good support for ESM.

To enable ESM for a script you can do it by:

Set the `type: "module"` property inside your project's `package.json`

**OR**

Change the file extension from `.js` to `.mjs`

### 🔍 Few important points

> We will deep dive into these points with real code examples, in the workshop.

- ES modules are loaded and parsed asynchronously.
- ESM is [Tree-shakeable](https://web.dev/reduce-javascript-payloads-with-tree-shaking/),
  (due to ES6's static module structure)
- Can be used directly inside inline-script tags in HTML
- You can't directly import CJS inside ES Modules (workaround: using shims).
- You can't import directly import ESM inside CJS (workaround: dynamic imports).
